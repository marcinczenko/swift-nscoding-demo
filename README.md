## Swift NSCoding Demo

This is a demo project that demonstrates how serialise and deserialise arrays of objects in Swift using `NSCoding` protocol.

Take a look at the tests that demosntrate how to use serializable abstraction.

> I use [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) for testing. It is installed with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) package manager, but to get you start up easily out of the box, everything is inlcuded in the archive. Just clone the project, open in Xcode, and run the tests in the `ruyterbTests` target.

### Cloning and opening the project

    git clone https://github.com/marcinczenko/swift-nscoding-demo.git
    cd swift-nscoding-demo
    open swift-nscoding-demo.xcodeproj

Enjoy!
